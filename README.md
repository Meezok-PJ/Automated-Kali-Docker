### Kali Sandbox: A Secure & Rapid Testing Environment

>- **Kali Sandbox** is a project I developed to solve a common pain point for developers and security researchers: the time-consuming process of setting up a secure Kali Linux testing environment. This single-script solution automates the entire setup, deploying a complete, isolated Kali container in seconds, not minutes.
>- The project provides a safe, repeatable, and fast way to test scripts and toolsâ€”even potentially malicious ones without any risk to your host system.

#### **Key Features**:

| **Feature**                | **Benefit**                                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rapid Deployment**       | Go from zero to a fully functional Kali environment in seconds, not minutes.                                                             |
| **Host System Protection** | The container provides true isolation, so a buggy script or a malicious tool will not affect your main operating system.                 |
| **Persistent Storage**     | A dedicated volume ensures all your work, scripts, and data are saved and available even after the container is shut down and restarted. |
| **Pre-installed Toolset**  | The `Dockerfile` includes essential tools like `nmap`, `curl`, and `git`, saving you from repetitive manual installations.               |
| **Portability**            | The `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` ensure the exact same environment can be recreated on any machine with Docker installed.       |

#### **The Problem Solved**

The traditional method of setting up a Kali container is slow. It involves pulling a minimal image and then manually installing all the necessary packages one by one. This process is not only a major time sink but also introduces the risk of human error.

The Kali Sandbox project eliminates this frustration by providing a pre-configured and ready-to-use environment.

#### **How to Use It**

To get started with the Kali Sandbox, you only need to run a single script.

1. **Make the script executable:**
    
    ```bash
    chmod +x docker.sh
    ```
    
2. **Run the Help script:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo ./docker.sh or ./docker.sh help

	```

3. **Builds the container or and create the Directories  :
	 ```bash 
     sudo ./docker.sh start
    ```
- After Running   the `start` |  these directories will be created `~/kali_sanbox` directory u will find the `README.md` file make sure u read it if your not fmiliar with docker/docker-compose and to view my Project info

    `start` will build the Docker image (if it doesn't exist).

4. **Accessing the Docker Image**
    
    ```bash
     sudo ./docker.sh access 
    ```

5. Uninstalling Container: Uninstall  Docker and Remove the Folder created by the script `~/user/sandbox and ~/user/kali_sandbox`

#### **Verifying Persistent Storage**

You can easily verify that your data is being saved.

1. Access the container using `./docker.sh access`.
2. Navigate to the `/mnt` directory and create a new file.
3. Exit the container `exit`.
4. Run `./docker.sh start` and then `./docker.sh access` to re-enter.
5. Check the `~/sandbox` directory. You will find the file you created in `/mnt` from the previous session, confirming that the data has been saved persistently.

#### **Example Use Case: Running `Sn1per` Recon Framework**

- The true value of this project is demonstrated when running complex tools with multiple dependencies, such as the **Sn1per Recon Framework**. Instead of manually installing all of the framework's dependencies, the Kali Sandbox provides a pre-configured, isolated environment where you can test the tool safely and with full functionality, right out of the box.

This saves a significant amount of time and ensures you have a consistent environment for your security analysis.

#### **How It Was Built**

>- This project was a fun way to put my skills to the test. It's a great example of my proficiency in **Bash scripting** and my solid **Linux fundamentals** in action. It shows how I love tackling a common developer frustration with a practical, automated solution.
>- The project leverages a `Dockerfile` to specify the base image and pre-install key packages, while a `docker-compose.yml` file is used to configure the container's capabilities (e.g., raw network access) and set up the persistent volume.

### **Current Limitations**:
>- While the project provides significant advantages, it's important to be aware of its current limitations. As of now, the project's script does not automatically handle the required Linux capabilities for certain networking tools.
>- For instance, when running tools like `nmap`, you may encounter an `"Operation not permitted"` error. This is due to Docker's default security settings, which limit a container's access to the host's network stack. To resolve this, you must manually launch the container with the `--cap-add=NET_RAW` and `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` flags.
>- This limitation means that some tools may require manual configuration, which is a key area for future development to make the Kali Sandbox truly seamless.

- This project leverages the efficiency of containerization over a traditional virtual machine. By sharing the host's Linux kernel, the container is significantly more lightweight and starts much faster than a full VM. This combination of speed, security, and portability makes the Kali Sandbox an ideal tool for any developer or security researcher looking for a reliable and efficient testing environment.
